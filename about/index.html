	<h1>About Prostor</h1>
	<p>The idea of Prostor (translates as 'space' in English) started at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, 
	University of Ljubljana some time ago. We wanted to create a joint website that serves as an archive and access point for
	open source projects from our university. We've gathered a solid amount of such projects and we're happy to showcase them
	here.<br>
	<br>
	All projects here are licensed under one of the open source licences (GPL, MIT, CC...) and are free to download, use,
	resue and, especially, contribute to.<br>
	<br>
	Together we're making open source stronger and better!</p>
